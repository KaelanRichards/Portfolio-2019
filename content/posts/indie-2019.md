description: "I took a look back at the 2010s and meticulously handpicked picked, my favorite, non-rap songs."
---

Alright, folks!

As we start the 2020s, it is important to reflect on and remember the 2010s. The ‘10s were a big decade for the music industry. Streaming services allowed music to be far more accessible than ever before and offered unprecedented data collection.

The genres that dominated the 2010s were Hip-Hop and Mainstream Pop. but between all the Justin Bieber and Drake hits, were songs that, to me, were the true gems, the lowkey hits.

It was very difficult to compile my favorite non-rap songs of the 2010s into a short (ish) list. Many artists deserved to have multiple songs but I decided to only allot one song per artist. I included honorable mentions under some of the artists, as well.

### What this list **is not**:

As much as I love Hip hop, it does not contain that, that will be a separate list.

No Country(Obviously), R&B, Heavy Metal, electronic.

### What this list **is**

It is in order Descending meaning 32 - 1.

It is all my opinion

It is **mostly** Indie (rock, pop, lofi, folk)
