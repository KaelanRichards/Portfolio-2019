# Top 30 *non-rap* *lowkey* Songs of the 2010s by Kado
#music #Lists


Alright, folks! 

As we start the 2020s, it is important to reflect on and remember the 2010s. The ‘10s was a big decade for the music industry. Streaming services allowed music far more accessible than ever before and opffered unprecedented data collection. 

The genres that dominated the 2010s were Hip-Hop and Mainstream Pop. but between all the Justin Bieber and Drake hits, were songs that, to me, were the true gems, the lowkey hits. 

It was very difficult to compile my favorite non rap songs of the 2010s into a short (ish) list. Many artist deserved to have multiple songs but I decided to only a lot one song per artist. I included honorable mentions under some of the artist

### What this list *is not*:
As much as I love rap, it does not contain that, that will be a separate list. 

### What this list *is*
It is in order Descending meaning 32 - 1.
It is all my opinion
It is *mostly* Indie (rock, pop, loft, folk)

I hope you enjoy this list :)
