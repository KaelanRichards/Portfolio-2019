So, my name is Kaelan Richards. I am 24 years old. I currently work as a software engineer.

Not much time has passed since I decided I wanted to join the tech industry. I remember the exact moment I declared it. Not the date but just the moment. The feelings.

I attended Michigan State University (MSU) where I graduated with a bachelors degree in criminal justice — something that I chose out of simplicity and slight interest.

I had a unique college experience. I was a full time athlete and part time student. Academics were always pegged down on the priority list by wrestling. From age 19–23 I trained like it was a full time job. Well long before that actually. I started at the age of 7… so you can do the math. Wrestling was my life. Wrestling taught me so much. I could write a separate article on that but it is simply out of the scope of this article. As valuable as it was, it sucked the life out of me and left nothing else for me to give in other aspects such as relationships, academics, and other things. I may be overdramatizing this but it did cripple me somewhat. My life was dedicated to that sport. I had no room to ponder, to think about what I actually wanted to do with my life post wrestling.

The natural path would be to join the police academy and become a cop. My ultimate goal was to become a fed… or so I thought it was.

I was driving through the West Virginia mountains on a sunny day in mid August of 2017. I was 22, Freshly graduated and confused, frankly. Student loan debt up to my neck and lost. At the time I was still live in East Lansing — hometown of MSU — working full time as a server at a local sushi restaurant(shoutout Sansu) !!

The mountains were beautiful and the people were unique. I’ve never expereinced something like West Virgina. When people refer to “mountain men” I understand what they mean now. It was not uncommon to drive through a “town” pieced together by trailers and RVs.

It was a long ways from virgina to Michigan, 8 hours or so. I don’t mind, though, driving is one of my favorite things, mostly because it forces me to be bored. To stop and actually think about things. I’ve become a slave to devices and electronics. I’m in a constant state of distraction. Driving allows me to break away and just… think. I come to some of my greatest realizations while driving… and showering!

This road trip could not have come at a better time. I firmly believe it was an instrumental event that changed the course of my life. I was at a point where I felt like I had no direction or goals. I knew I wouldn’t settle until I found something I enjoyed doing and was passionate about. I left on that trip with intentions to brainstorm and explore my options. I said “Brain, I need you focused up and be ready to go!! I want you to go to work on this trip!”

It popped into my head out of no where. Coding. “What is coding?” I thought. I’ve always known about it but only rudimentary understanding. I always assumed I wasn’t smart enough or didn’t have enough time to study with wrestling. Coding? Why did this come to me out of the blue? It all clicked for me in that moment.

I have always been around technology because of my older brother. He always was seeking out the latest and greatest tech. Whether it were video games consoles, computers, or the newest smart phone. He ended up a in the more creative tech space making 3d models.

There were a couple things that really drew me to tech. 

1. Technology is still in its infancy. "Day 0" as Jeff Bezos put it.
2. Equiped with the skills of coding, you can bring your ideas to life.
3. The flebility it proides

## Day 0

Comparatively speaking, Technology is but a baby when looking at other industries. The ones who are paving the way now will be in the history books as founders of technology... think Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Jeff bezos. 

I want to be apart of this revolutionary technology movement. I wanted to be in the history books

## Coding

I don't have to speak much on the benefits of knowing how to code. The obious benefits being pay, relaxed work culture, being a magician in general. The thing that really got me was being able to bring ideas to life. Have you ever been in the shower and out of no where a brilliant app idea comes to mind?? Imagine having the ability to immediatly act on that idea. Imagine having a prototype whipped up in  a matter of days at no cost. If it ends up being a shitty idea -- no problem! just scrap it and move on. It's quite a beautiful thing.

## Flexibility

My favorite thing about this industry and working as a programmer is the flexibility it provides. Every company needs a website, mobile app, or desktop app. You can't get away without it these days. I can move to almost any city in the entire world and have oppurtunities available. If not I'll work remote. 

The oppurtunity is insane. 



# My Goals

I'm in the field and working as a professional programmer... what now? 

I am working to start my own business or.. start up as they call it in the tech field. I am going to move to a city that will provide lots of oppurtunity. Who knows, maybe I'll start the next google!!
